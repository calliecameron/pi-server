# Certificates

Scripts to set up a custom CA and generate certificates.

## Set up a CA

```shell
./make-ca <dir> <name>
```

## Create certificates

### For a server

```shell
cd <dir>
./scripts/make-pi-server-certs
```

### For an OpenVPN client

```shell
cd <dir>
./scripts/make-client-cert
```

## Revoke a certificate

```shell
cd <dir>
./scripts/revoke-cert <cert>
```

## Install certificates on the server

Copy all the files in the folder generated by make-pi-server-certs to
`/etc/pi-server/certs` on the server, and make sure they are owned by root,
with the correct permissions.
